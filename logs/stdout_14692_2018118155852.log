      Dan
      Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Dan, and joining me today is Neil. Hi Neil.
      Neil
      Hi, everyone!
      Dan
      Bless you! Are you ok?
      Neil
      I think I'm coming down with something serious.
      Dan
      It's just a case of the sniffles.
      Neil
      The sniffles is an informal way of saying a cold or flu. It comes from the sniffing sound people make when they have a runny nose.
      Dan
      And a runny nose is when liquid mucus keeps leaking from our nose - usually when we are sick. I'm afraid you'll just have to soldier on Neil.
      Neil
      To soldier on means to continue despite difficulty. I'm dying! What's it about anyway?
      Dan
      It's about `man flu', and whether it's actually real, or just something men like to complain about. We'll give you 6 words and expressions - and, of course, our quiz question.
      Neil
      Alright, fire away.
      Dan 
      In a survey conducted by Nuts magazine that asked its readers how long they took to recover from a cold or flu, where women put an average of 1.5 days, what did men put? a) 1 day, b) 2 days or c) 3 days
      Neil
      I'm going to say 3 days. The threat of `man flu' is real.
      Dan
      Well, we'll find out later, but let's clarify. `Man flu' is the tendency that many people believe men have to complain about a minor illness, such as a cold or flu, and act as if they were suffering from something a lot more serious.
      Neil
      Yes. But science cannot say whether men do actually suffer more than women, or if men just tend to complain more.
      Dan
      Well, let's hear from this British couple about whether they think `man flu' is real or not.
      Vox
      British Man
      Men definitely do suffer a lot more, I think, than women do when we get flu.
      British Woman
      Yeah, I'm not so convinced. I feel like they just complain more.
      British Man
      It wipes me out.
      British Woman
      I was ill recently and I just carried on and went to work and everything. And when Chris had got sick recently he was on the sofa and couldn't really do anything, so.
      Dan
      And it seems that it's not just in the UK. Listen to this BBC Journalist interviewing a woman from Europe.
      Vox
      BBC Journalist
      You're from the Netherlands. Have you ever accused your boyfriend of having man flu?
      Dutch woman
      Oh, absolutely yes. Yeah.
      BBC Journalist
      What have you accused him of doing?
      Dutch woman
      .whining?
      Neil
      Whining is when someone complains repeatedly and often in an annoying way about something. So, there certainly seems to be something there.but nothing has been proven, right?
      Dan
      Well, a recent scientific study has indicated that there could be something to `man flu' after all. Doctor Kyle Sue, an assistant professor of family medicine at Memorial University of Newfoundland in Canada, has suggested that there could be a difference between men and women when it comes to respiratory diseases.
      Neil
      Respiratory meaning related to breathing. He says that there was already a lot of evidence from existing studies suggesting men experience worse, longer-lasting symptoms.
      Dan
      Symptoms are the feelings of illness caused by a disease. Listen to him explain why this is.
      Doctor Kyle Sue
      Memorial University, Newfoundland
      It seems that the higher the testosterone levels, the lower the immune response to these types of infections, whereas the higher the oestrogen level, the stronger the immune response.
      Neil
      Testosterone and oestrogen are hormones that exist in both men and women. Testosterone is higher in males and oestrogen is higher in females. Dr. Sue's research suggests that the more oestrogen a person has, the better able they are to fight off the infection. That's it then! Man flu is real!
      Dan
      Hold your horses, Neil. There are two problems. First of all, the Royal college of GPs in the UK says that there is no such thing as `man flu'. And secondly, even Dr Sue admits that these results, including his own, are only `suggestive' and are not `definitive'.
      Neil
      So, basically he's saying that there is a suggestion that `man flu' exists, but the evidence so far cannot say for sure.
      Dan
      Exactly. More studies need to be done. But you know what we can be sure about? The answer to this week's quiz question. I asked you in a survey conducted by Nuts magazine that asked its readers how long they took to recover from a cold or flu, where women put an average of 1.5 days, what did men put? a) 1 day, b) 2 days or c) 3 days
      Neil
      And I said 3 days.
      Dan
      And you were right!
      Neil
      Good!
      Dan
      The men said they took twice as long to recover!
      Neil
      It must be all that manly testosterone. Let's review our vocabulary, shall we?
      Dan
      Our first was the sniffles. If you have the sniffles, you have a cold, informally speaking. What's the best cure for the sniffles Neil?
      Neil
      Stay in bed and sweat it out, my mum always said. Just make sure you have lots of tissues to deal with your runny nose. That's when a person's nose leaks mucus, usually because they are ill. Yuck!
      Dan
      Next we had soldier on. This phrasal verb means to continue despite difficulty. When was the last time you had to soldier on, Neil?
      Neil
      A few days ago when I went the whole day without eating any lunch! Then we had `man flu'. That's is the name given to the situation where a person, often a man, tends to complain and exaggerate a small illness such as a cold. Do you do that, Dan?
      Dan
      I'm sure my wife would say I do! Next we had whining. If you whine, you complain repeatedly and often in an annoying way.
      Neil
      Like my children did last time I didn't buy them ice-cream. And finally we had symptoms. These are the feelings of illness caused by a disease. What are the symptoms of flu, Dan?
      Dan
      A headache, aching muscles, and a fever. And that's the end of this 6 Minute English! Don't forget to check out our YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages. There you made it. You can collapse now.
      Neil
      Bye.
      Dan
      Bye!
      , Dan,Neil,British Man,British Woman,BBC Journalist,Dutch woman,Doctor Kyle Sue, Can science prove the existence of 'man flu' or are men just big babies? Dan and Neil discuss all this and give you six useful items of vocabulary., the sniffles: a cold (informally)
      runny nose: when a person's nose leaks mucus
      soldier on: continue despite difficulty
      man flu: the situation where a person, often a man, tends to complain and exaggerate a small illness such as a cold
      whining: complaining repeatedly often in an annoying way
      symptoms: feelings of illness caused by a disease
