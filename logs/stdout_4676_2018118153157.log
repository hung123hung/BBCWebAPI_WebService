      Dan
      Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Dan, and joining me today is Neil. Hi Neil.
      Neil
      Hi, everyone!
      Dan
      Bless you! Are you ok?
      Neil
      I think I'm coming down with something serious.
      Dan
      It's just a case of the sniffles.
      Neil
      The sniffles is an informal way of saying a cold or flu. It comes from the sniffing sound people make when they have a runny nose.
      Dan
      And a runny nose is when liquid mucus keeps leaking from our nose - usually when we are sick. I'm afraid you'll just have to soldier on Neil.
      Neil
      To soldier on means to continue despite difficulty. I'm dying! What's it about anyway?
      Dan
      It's about `man flu', and whether it's actually real, or just something men like to complain about. We'll give you 6 words and expressions - and, of course, our quiz question.
      Neil
      Alright, fire away.
      Dan 
      In a survey conducted by Nuts magazine that asked its readers how long they took to recover from a cold or flu, where women put an average of 1.5 days, what did men put? a) 1 day, b) 2 days or c) 3 days
      Neil
      I'm going to say 3 days. The threat of `man flu' is real.
      Dan
      Well, we'll find out later, but let's clarify. `Man flu' is the tendency that many people believe men have to complain about a minor illness, such as a cold or flu, and act as if they were suffering from something a lot more serious.
      Neil
      Yes. But science cannot say whether men do actually suffer more than women, or if men just tend to complain more.
      Dan
      Well, let's hear from this British couple about whether they think `man flu' is real or not.
      Vox
      British Man
      Men definitely do suffer a lot more, I think, than women do when we get flu.
      British Woman
      Yeah, I'm not so convinced. I feel like they just complain more.
      British Man
      It wipes me out.
      British Woman
      I was ill recently and I just carried on and went to work and everything. And when Chris had got sick recently he was on the sofa and couldn't really do anything, so.
      Dan
      And it seems that it's not just in the UK. Listen to this BBC Journalist interviewing a woman from Europe.
      Vox
      BBC Journalist
      You're from the Netherlands. Have you ever accused your boyfriend of having man flu?
      Dutch woman
      Oh, absolutely yes. Yeah.
      BBC Journalist
      What have you accused him of doing?
      Dutch woman
      .whining?
      Neil
      Whining is when someone complains repeatedly and often in an annoying way about something. So, there certainly seems to be something there.but nothing has been proven, right?
      Dan
      Well, a recent scientific study has indicated that there could be something to `man flu' after all. Doctor Kyle Sue, an assistant professor of family medicine at Memorial University of Newfoundland in Canada, has suggested that there could be a difference between men and women when it comes to respiratory diseases.
      Neil
      Respiratory meaning related to breathing. He says that there was already a lot of evidence from existing studies suggesting men experience worse, longer-lasting symptoms.
      Dan
      Symptoms are the feelings of illness caused by a disease. Listen to him explain why this is.
      Doctor Kyle Sue
      Memorial University, Newfoundland
      It seems that the higher the testosterone levels, the lower the immune response to these types of infections, whereas the higher the oestrogen level, the stronger the immune response.
      Neil
      Testosterone and oestrogen are hormones that exist in both men and women. Testosterone is higher in males and oestrogen is higher in females. Dr. Sue's research suggests that the more oestrogen a person has, the better able they are to fight off the infection. That's it then! Man flu is real!
      Dan
      Hold your horses, Neil. There are two problems. First of all, the Royal college of GPs in the UK says that there is no such thing as `man flu'. And secondly, even Dr Sue admits that these results, including his own, are only `suggestive' and are not `definitive'.
      Neil
      So, basically he's saying that there is a suggestion that `man flu' exists, but the evidence so far cannot say for sure.
      Dan
      Exactly. More studies need to be done. But you know what we can be sure about? The answer to this week's quiz question. I asked you in a survey conducted by Nuts magazine that asked its readers how long they took to recover from a cold or flu, where women put an average of 1.5 days, what did men put? a) 1 day, b) 2 days or c) 3 days
      Neil
      And I said 3 days.
      Dan
      And you were right!
      Neil
      Good!
      Dan
      The men said they took twice as long to recover!
      Neil
      It must be all that manly testosterone. Let's review our vocabulary, shall we?
      Dan
      Our first was the sniffles. If you have the sniffles, you have a cold, informally speaking. What's the best cure for the sniffles Neil?
      Neil
      Stay in bed and sweat it out, my mum always said. Just make sure you have lots of tissues to deal with your runny nose. That's when a person's nose leaks mucus, usually because they are ill. Yuck!
      Dan
      Next we had soldier on. This phrasal verb means to continue despite difficulty. When was the last time you had to soldier on, Neil?
      Neil
      A few days ago when I went the whole day without eating any lunch! Then we had `man flu'. That's is the name given to the situation where a person, often a man, tends to complain and exaggerate a small illness such as a cold. Do you do that, Dan?
      Dan
      I'm sure my wife would say I do! Next we had whining. If you whine, you complain repeatedly and often in an annoying way.
      Neil
      Like my children did last time I didn't buy them ice-cream. And finally we had symptoms. These are the feelings of illness caused by a disease. What are the symptoms of flu, Dan?
      Dan
      A headache, aching muscles, and a fever. And that's the end of this 6 Minute English! Don't forget to check out our YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages. There you made it. You can collapse now.
      Neil
      Bye.
      Dan
      Bye!
      , Dan,Neil,British Man,British Woman,BBC Journalist,Dutch woman,Doctor Kyle Sue, Can science prove the existence of 'man flu' or are men just big babies? Dan and Neil discuss all this and give you six useful items of vocabulary., the sniffles: a cold (informally)
      runny nose: when a person's nose leaks mucus
      soldier on: continue despite difficulty
      man flu: the situation where a person, often a man, tends to complain and exaggerate a small illness such as a cold
      whining: complaining repeatedly often in an annoying way
      symptoms: feelings of illness caused by a disease

      Neil
      Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Neil and joining me today is Dan who is looking very jolly. Dan
      Of course I'm looking jolly - meaning happy and smiley; it's my favourite time of the year.
      Neil
      Ah yes, all that food, all those presents, all that fun. 
      Dan
      Forget the food and fun - Christmas is all about the presents!
      Neil
      I'm not sure that's quite the spirit - the real meaning of something
      Dan
      Well, Neil, I was actually talking about giving presents, not getting them.
      Neil
      Ah sorry, Dan, I misjudged you. As you enjoy giving presents so much, I'm very pleased to have you with me in this 6 Minute English - Our topic. What makes the perfect Santa? We'll have 6 items of vocabulary for you and, of course, our quiz question. Ready?
      Dan
      Hit me.
      Neil
      How many Santas are there in the world? a) 1,500, b) 15,000 or c) 15 million
      Dan
      I know there are a lot but 15 million must be wrong; 1,500 seems too few, so I'll g o for 15,000.
      Neil
      We'll see if you're right at the end of the programmer. Dan, you seem like a strong candidate for a job as Santa. Ever considered it?
      Dan|I'd love to! A candidate is a person competing for a job.
      Neil
      And what do you think is a key part of being Santa - or Father Christmas as we also call him in the UK?
      Dan
      You've already mentioned being jolly.
      Neil
      I have. Let's listen to James Lovell, who runs a Santa school at his company Ministry of Fun in London. What does he say is the key?
      James Lovell
      A perfect 'ho ho ho!' is a key part of being a Father Christmas. It's a ho ho ho! And it needs to just reinforce the fact that you are the jolliest person on the planet. So I like to reach down into my tummy, tap it and with a big smile on my face g o ho ho hoooo! 
      Neil 
       The perfect ho ho ho! You need that to reinforce the fact you are the jolliest person in the world. 
      Dan
      To reinforce means to make something stronger. Ho ho ho! 
      Neil
      Wow, Dan! You're very convincing. Are you sure you've never done this before? 
      Dan
      I haven't but I want to. It feels good! Ho ho ho! 
      Neil
      I could be the ideal career move for you, Dan. But I bet it's not all fun. 
      Dan
      Hmm, maybe. I think there would be a lot of pressure to perform. Pressure is the feeling of worry you can get when you are expected to deal with a difficult situation. 
      Neil
      Yes, think of all the children you have to impress. Pressure indeed. Let's hear from James Lovell again, who runs a Santa school in London. 
      James Lovell
      Portraying Father Christmas is not an easy job because when you're dressed as Father Christmas, you have a huge responsibility to recreate the magic of the real Santa in every way. You need to look good, you need to have lots to say and you need to be incredibly jolly and you need to have magical eyes. 
      Dan
      So it seems I was right: portraying Father Christmas is not an easy job. Portraying meaning playing the part of - like an actor does. 
      Neil
      He says there's a huge responsibility to recreate the magic of the real Santa. To recreate means to make something exist again. 
      Dan
      All those kids expecting that magical moment - and it's all down to you as Santa! Hmm I'm beginning to have second thoughts about this career change.
      Neil
      Could you handle the pressure? 
      Dan
      I'm not sure I could! Portraying Father Christmas might be a challenge too far - despite my ho ho ho! 
      Neil
      Now it's time to find out the answer to our quiz question. I asked how many Santas there are in the world? a) 1,500, b) 15,000 or c) 15 million
      Dan
      I said b) 15,000
      Neil
      And you were. wrong! I'm afraid it was a trick question - there is, of course, only one Santa! 
      Dan
      Ahhh that's not fair! 
      Neil
      Sorry! Shall we have a recap of the vocabulary? 
      Dan
      Yes please - that would make me jolly again. 
      Neil
      Jolly, meaning happy and smiley. What makes you jolly, Dan? 
      Dan
      Christmas of course! Now Neil, I have to say, cheating me out of that quiz question was really not in the spirit of 6 Minute English. We are always nice to each other. 
      Neil
      Ah yes, you're probably right. Spirt here has the sense of something's real meaning. The spirit of 6 Minute English is friendly educational fun - not cheating your colleagues! 
      Dan
      Glad we've got that straight. Our next word is candidate. Until you made me think about how hard it is to be a good Santa, I thought I'd be a strong candidate for the job. 
      Neil
      A candidate is a person competing for a job. Next we had reinforce. 
      Dan
      Reinforce means to make something stronger. Repeating the vocabulary in 6 Minute English reinforces your ability to remember it! 
      Neil
      That's right - and it puts you under less pressure when you're speaking English if you have a good range of vocabulary. 
      Dan
      Pressure is the feeling of worry you can get when you are expected to deal with a difficult situation - like pretending to be Santa! Yes there's a lot of pressure involved in portraying someone else. 
      Neil
      Portraying, meaning playing the part of someone - like an actor does. It can be very difficult to get it right. 
      Dan
      Yep, it's a real skill to be able to recreate the look and character of another person. Recreate meaning to make something exist again. 
      Neil
      Well we'll try our best to recreate a positive learning experience for you all next time on 6 Minute English. Until then don't forget to check out our YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages. Goodbye! 
      Dan
      Goodbye!

      Neil
      Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Neil and joining me today is Dan who is looking very jolly. Dan
      Of course I'm looking jolly - meaning happy and smiley; it's my favourite time of the year.
      Neil
      Ah yes, all that food, all those presents, all that fun. 
      Dan
      Forget the food and fun - Christmas is all about the presents!
      Neil
      I'm not sure that's quite the spirit - the real meaning of something
      Dan
      Well, Neil, I was actually talking about giving presents, not getting them.
      Neil
      Ah sorry, Dan, I misjudged you. As you enjoy giving presents so much, I'm very pleased to have you with me in this 6 Minute English - Our topic. What makes the perfect Santa? We'll have 6 items of vocabulary for you and, of course, our quiz question. Ready?
      Dan
      Hit me.
      Neil
      How many Santas are there in the world? a) 1,500, b) 15,000 or c) 15 million
      Dan
      I know there are a lot but 15 million must be wrong; 1,500 seems too few, so I'll g o for 15,000.
      Neil
      We'll see if you're right at the end of the programmer. Dan, you seem like a strong candidate for a job as Santa. Ever considered it?
      Dan|I'd love to! A candidate is a person competing for a job.
      Neil
      And what do you think is a key part of being Santa - or Father Christmas as we also call him in the UK?
      Dan
      You've already mentioned being jolly.
      Neil
      I have. Let's listen to James Lovell, who runs a Santa school at his company Ministry of Fun in London. What does he say is the key?
      James Lovell
      A perfect 'ho ho ho!' is a key part of being a Father Christmas. It's a ho ho ho! And it needs to just reinforce the fact that you are the jolliest person on the planet. So I like to reach down into my tummy, tap it and with a big smile on my face g o ho ho hoooo! 
      Neil 
       The perfect ho ho ho! You need that to reinforce the fact you are the jolliest person in the world. 
      Dan
      To reinforce means to make something stronger. Ho ho ho! 
      Neil
      Wow, Dan! You're very convincing. Are you sure you've never done this before? 
      Dan
      I haven't but I want to. It feels good! Ho ho ho! 
      Neil
      I could be the ideal career move for you, Dan. But I bet it's not all fun. 
      Dan
      Hmm, maybe. I think there would be a lot of pressure to perform. Pressure is the feeling of worry you can get when you are expected to deal with a difficult situation. 
      Neil
      Yes, think of all the children you have to impress. Pressure indeed. Let's hear from James Lovell again, who runs a Santa school in London. 
      James Lovell

      Neil
      He says there's a huge responsibility to recreate the magic of the real Santa. To recreate means to make something exist again. 
      Dan
      All those kids expecting that magical moment - and it's all down to you as Santa! Hmm I'm beginning to have second thoughts about this career change.
      Neil
      Could you handle the pressure?

      Ah yes, you're probably right. Spirt here has the sense of something's real meaning. The spirit of 6 Minute English is friendly educational fun - not cheating your colleagues!
